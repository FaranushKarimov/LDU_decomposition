# LDU_Decomposition

This repository contains an [LDU Decomposition Function](https://github.com/siquike/LDU_decomposition/blob/master/LDU.ipynb) implemented in MATLAB.

A numerical Method of Factorizing a matrix into a lower triangular matrix, a diagonal matrix, and an upper triangular matrix. By having lower/Upper triangular matrices, computations are easy through forward/back substitution respectively [[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_matrix#Forward_and_back_substitution)].

LDU decomposition is usually used to solve linear systems of equations, inverting matrices, and computing determinants [[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LU_decomposition#Applications)].
